# Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Support Vector Machine

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on various features. The dataset used in this project is provided in the "Cancer_Data.csv" file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```shell
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Prometheussx/Breast-Cancer-SVM.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd YourProject
```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the breast cancer diagnosis using SVM.

```shell
python breast_cancer_diagnosis.py
```

2. View the results, including the accuracy of the SVM algorithm on the test data.
